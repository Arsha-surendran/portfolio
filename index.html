            <h3>Online Sports Turf Playground Booking System</h3>
            <p><h4>🔴 Problem</h4>

Traditional turf booking depended on manual methods and offline communication, making it difficult for users to check availability, compare turf locations and prices, and manage reservations efficiently. This led to booking conflicts, lack of transparency, and time-consuming processes for both users and administrators.<br>
<h4>🟢 Solution</h4>
Developed a web-based Online Sports Turf Booking System that allows users to search nearby turfs, check real-time availability, book playgrounds, make payments, and view booking history 24×7. The system supports role-based access for Users, Managers, and Admins, ensuring streamlined booking operations and accurate turf management.<br>
<h4>👩‍💻 My Role & Contributions</h4>
Designed and implemented the backend using Django for booking logic, authentication, and role-based access control
Integrated PostgreSQL database to manage user data, turf details, pricing, and booking history
Implemented real-time availability validation to prevent double bookings
Developed responsive frontend interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Enabled manager approval workflows and admin controls for turf allocation and price management
